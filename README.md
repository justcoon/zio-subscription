# zio subscription

simple subscription service, which managing subscription data (email and address) for users

demo implementation of outbox pattern with change data capture (CDC)

# outbox pattern with CDC

the idea of this approach is to have an "outbox" table in the serviceâ€™s database which is used like event journal for [domain events](https://serialized.io/ddd/domain-event/)

while applying a change to the subscription data, not only insert/update/delete query on subscription table is done, 
but together with that, as part of the same transaction, also a record representing the event is inserted into that outbox table

then CDC is used to capture changes from outbox table, in this case events are produced to kafka

# required
* postgres
* kafka

## postgres wal setup (CDC)

setup

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;
```
and then restart and check

```sql
SHOW wal_level;
```

## config

app mode:
* all - default, svc and cdc features
* svc - service features - api, domain impl.
* cdc - change data capture processing, just one instance/replica of service should run that
